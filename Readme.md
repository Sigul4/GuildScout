# GuildScout: The Community Analytics Platform

## 🌟 Executive Summary

This project delivers the foundational technology stack for a powerful, scalable analytics platform. Its core function is to systematically collect, process, and store all user and content data from designated Discord guilds. By structuring this information, GuildScout enables deep reporting and strategic decision-making for community managers and business owners.

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview (What It Is)

GuildScout is engineered for stability and handling large volumes of data. It operates using a modern, best-practice architecture:

1.  **High-Performance Processing (Node.js/TypeScript):** The application logic is built on Node.js, ensuring the platform can quickly and efficiently handle thousands of simultaneous events from your guilds without delay.
2.  **Guaranteed Data Handling (Kafka):** We use a streaming platform called **Kafka** as a highly reliable intermediary. This ensures that *every* piece of data—whether it's a message, a voice connection, or a status update—is captured, queued, and processed without loss, even during peak activity.
3.  **Reliable Data Storage (PostgreSQL & Prisma):** All processed analytical data is stored in a secure PostgreSQL database. We use **Prisma** to maintain a clear, consistent structure (schema) for your data, ensuring data integrity and ease of future reporting.
4.  **Self-Contained Environment (Docker):** The entire system, including the application, database, and Kafka server, is packaged using Docker. This guarantees that the platform runs identically and reliably across any environment (development, testing, or production).

## 📊 Key Business Outcomes (What It Delivers)

The primary goal of GuildScout is to answer critical questions about your community that are impossible to solve using standard Discord tools.

| Analytical Focus | Client Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Engagement** 🎯 | Identify your most active members and the best times for community events. |
| **Retention & Churn Rate** 📉 | Pinpoint why and when users are leaving, allowing proactive intervention to boost member lifetime value. |
| **Content and Trend Analysis** 💬 | Understand the most popular topics, keywords, and content driving conversations in your guild. |
| **Moderation and Health** 🛡️ | Monitor activity patterns to quickly detect shifts in community health or potential issues. |

## 📦 Project Status

All foundational elements are complete:

* The **Data Structure (Prisma Schema)** for tracking users, messages, and key metrics is defined.
* **Data Pipeline Configuration** (Docker and Kafka setup) for reliable data transfer is implemented.
* **Initial Database Migrations** (SQL files) are ready to deploy the storage environment.
* The project is organized into modular components (`app`, `bot`, `docker`) for clear separation of concerns and easier development.
